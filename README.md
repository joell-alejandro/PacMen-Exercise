# PacMen-Exercise

A demonstration using html and javascript to create an ininite number of pacmen on a webpage and with a click of the button 'start game' watch them bounce around the browser window at various speeds.

# How to run

You do not need any special software to run, although Google Chrome is recommended. If you'd like to edit the code an editor is needed such as VS Code.

# Roadmap of future improvements

It would be cool to add some ghosts in the mix, and have them interact with the pacmen that are created.
